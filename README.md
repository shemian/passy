create new account credentials in the application. For example, if I have not yet signed up for Instagram, I would want to create a credentials account for Instagram in the application and the application generates a password for me to use when I sign up for Instagram.
have the option of putting in a password that I want to use for the new credential account. For example, when creating my Instagram credential account, I want to have an option of putting in the password I want to use instead of having the application generate a password for me.
view my various account credentials and their passwords in the application.
Delete a credentials account that I no longer need in the application.
